- 👋 Hi, I’m @wyonot
- 👀 I’m interested in ... learning to program for machine learning applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing really. I'm not there yet.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Why the heck would you want to do that? Anyways, whatever your reasons are... my email address is davidferguson1392@outlook.com

When I retired from the California prison system last year I set a goal for myself to learn 1 or 2 major computer skills each year. 
Last year I learned a significant amount of 3D modelling using Maya and Blender. This year I plan to learn as much as I can about Python.

I spend around 8 to 12 hours a day learning when its cold outside (I live in Wyoming hence the user name) and would love to get the basics for Python down within 
a few months so I can begin to really learn it by writting a basic chatbot that can hold a conversation about artificial intelligence. 

I have a few ideas about how I would like to go about this and what features I would like to include but, at this stage in my development I really don't know if 
any of them are possible. I'm a newb. Shout out to all of the newbs in GitLand.
